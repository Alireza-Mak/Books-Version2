# About Project: Books creator Using React typescript - Version 2 (intermediate)

The "Books" application is an upgraded version developed with React and TypeScript, benefiting from React's Context API, Provider pattern, and hooks.

The CreateBook component enables users to add book names through an input field. This dynamically updates the interface and sends the book data to a JSON server (db.json) using HTTP requests.

Upon app initialization, the existing book data is fetched from the server, and each book is displayed in the list using the ShowBook component. The EditBook component allows users to edit book details, while the deletion feature lets them remove books. These actions are reflected both in the user interface and on the server side, utilizing HTTP PUT and DELETE requests.

The application is fully responsive, ensuring optimal performance across various screen sizes and adapting to different devices.

Furthermore, an api.http file is included, serving as a reference for making HTTP requests to the API, facilitating testing and integration.

Additionally, users can access the previous version of the application by following this link: https://github.com/Alireza-Mak/Books.

In summary, the "Books" application leverages React's advanced features, such as the Context API, Provider pattern, and hooks. It allows users to create, edit, and delete books, with data being synchronized between the user interface and the server. The app is designed to be fully responsive, and an api.http file is provided for API requests.
